## Introduction

This repository contains source code for all posts in my machine learning blog series. You can find each post below. Relevant code snippets are in `src/` and organized by `<post-number>-<description>`.

1. [Why I'm Writing About ML](http://benbrostoff.github.io/2017/09/19/why-ml/)
2. [Gradient Descent Intuition](http://benbrostoff.github.io/2017/10/09/gradient-descent-intuition/)
3. [Gradient Descent in Simple NN](http://benbrostoff.github.io/2017/12/06/gradient-descent-in-simple-nn-draft.html)
